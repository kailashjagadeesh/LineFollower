Checking analog value results: 
    tested using Arduino Mega
    All ok!

Checking digital value results:
    tested using arduino Mega
    DAC is set to on-board 3.3V

    observation: OPAMPS outputs are 2.8~ when HIGH (Mega reads that as LOW)

    Therefore checking, voltage using multimeter and analog reads
    Result: 
        * All opamps get proper voltage for comparison
        * Outputs of opamps (3.3v comparison value)
            all ok!
            for 0v i/p, o/p = 0v
            for 5v i/p, o/p = 2.10v 

            The results were cross verified using analog reads at corresponding digital pins (using jumpers)
            approx 437 was read.

Results with Due:

pin 34 - not connected properly to the respective opamp o/p
pin 40 - not connected properly
